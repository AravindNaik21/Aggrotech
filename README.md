# AGGROTECH üåø
#### A simple ML and DL based website which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops.

## MOTIVATION üí™
- The motivation behind this project stems from the critical role agriculture plays in a country‚Äôs economy, especially in countries like India, where a large portion of the population relies on farming for their livelihood. Despite its importance, agriculture often faces challenges such as low yields, inadequate resource management, and crop diseases, which affect the productivity and income of farmers.

- By integrating advanced technologies like Machine Learning and Deep Learning into farming, this project aims to make agriculture more efficient and accessible for farmers. The website brings together three essential tools‚Äîcrop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation, and plant disease prediction‚Äîeach designed to support farmers in making informed decisions.

    - The crop recommendation tool empowers farmers to make the best crop choice based on their soil's specific characteristics, optimizing growth potential.
    - The fertilizer recommendation tool helps farmers understand what their soil needs to achieve balanced nutrients, increasing soil health and crop yield.
    - The plant disease prediction tool provides early identification of plant diseases, enabling timely action and preventing widespread damage.
    - This project‚Äôs goal is to bridge the gap between modern technology and traditional farming, making it easier for farmers to adopt smarter practices that will maximize their yield, reduce costs, and improve sustainability. By offering practical, science-backed solutions, this initiative not only contributes to the prosperity of farmers but also supports the broader goal of improving agricultural efficiency and food security.
    - Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth. 


## How to use üíª
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them.

- Fertilizer suggestion system ==> Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

- Disease Detection System ==> Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly.
Note that, for now it only supports following crops

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
You can use this project for further developing it and adding your work in it. If you use this project, kindly mention the original source of the project and mention the link of this repo in your report.

## Further Improvements üìà
This was my first big project so there are lot of things to improve upon

- CSS code is totally messed up :pensive: (some code in file and some inline)
- Frontend can be made more nicer (PS: I suck at frontend development) :cry:	
- More data can be collected manually via web scrapping to make the system more accurate :monocle_face:	
- Additional plant images can be collected to make the disease detection part more robust and generalized :face_with_head_bandage:
- Modularized code can be written instead of writing in Jupyter Notebooks (will follow this in upcoming projects)
