    <h1>Coffee Fertilizer Recommendations</h1>
    <p>Proper fertilization is essential for healthy growth and optimal yield in coffee plants. Below are general guidelines for fertilizing coffee:</p>
    
    <h2>Fertilization Schedule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-Flowering (Approximately 30 Days Before Flowering):</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer with micronutrients to support cell division and flower induction. Incorporate boron (B), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) to enhance flower vitality.</li>
      <li><strong>Flowering Period (Approximately 30 Days):</strong> Maintain a balanced nitrogen (N) to potassium (K) ratio, ideally 1:1, to ensure growth and flower vitality. Seaweed extracts may support pollen quality and berry uniformity.</li>
      <li><strong>Fruit Set and Maturation (Approximately 150 Days):</strong> Increase potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) application to ensure proper fruit development and quality. Foliar spraying with potassium nitrate (Multi-K) can improve yield and bean size. It's recommended to start foliar applications 12 weeks after flowering, using a 4% Multi-K solution, followed by two more applications at 30-day intervals.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Fertilizer Types</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use formulations such as 19-4-21+0.8B+0.04Cu+0.1Mn+0.45Zn to provide essential nutrients during pre-flowering.</li>
      <li><strong>Potassium-Rich Fertilizers:</strong> Apply potassium nitrate (Multi-K) during fruit set and maturation to enhance bean quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Well-decomposed compost or manure can be used to improve soil fertility and structure.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Application Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Distribute fertilizer evenly around the base of the plant, avoiding direct contact with the stem.</li>
      <li>Water thoroughly after each application to help nutrients reach the root zone.</li>
      <li>Monitor plant health and adjust fertilization based on growth, leaf color, and soil test results.</li>
      <li>Consider soil pH and texture, as they influence nutrient availability and coffee quality. Liming may be necessary to correct soil acidity based on soil test recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note: Soil conditions and nutrient needs can vary. It's advisable to conduct a soil test for precise recommendations tailored to your specific conditions.</p>
